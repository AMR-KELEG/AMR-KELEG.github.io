Figures and Tables, in addition to examples, play an important role in clarifying scientific ideas, findings, and results. The more I read and write papers, the more I appreciate well-designed visualizations. A colleague once told me that the quality of visualizations in a presentation is a good proxy for estimating the amount of time and effort exerted preparing for the presentation. Given the time needed to generate a clear visualization, I am starting to believe this proxy is sufficiently accurate.

Despite the fact art was not my favorite subject in school, I think generating digital visualizations is one of my talents, that is continuously getting better. I will try to showcase my journey, shedding light on how my older visualizations (aka artworks) could have been better!
