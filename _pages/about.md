My name is Amr Keleg عمرو قلج (/ʕamr/ /kɯˈɫɯtʃ/). I am a PhD student (CDT in NLP) at the University of Edinburgh, working under the supervison of [Walid Magdy](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wmagdy/) and [Sharon Goldwater](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/sgwater/).
I am studying the differences between the Arabic dialects, and the mutual intelligiblity of them.
I come from Egypt where I completed my undergraduate and masters degrees, and worked as a teaching assistant at Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University.
