My name is Amr Keleg. I come from Egypt and has a computer engineering degree from Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt. I am passionate about mathematics and am currently doing research in the field of natural language processing (NLP) focusing on Arabic and its variant dialects.
