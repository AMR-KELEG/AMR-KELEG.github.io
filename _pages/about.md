Hello (Ø£Ù‡Ù„Ù‹Ø§ ÙˆØ³Ù‡Ù„Ù‹Ø§)! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

My name is Amr Keleg Ø¹Ù…Ø±Ùˆ Ù‚Ù„Ø¬ (/Ê•amr/ /kÉ¯ËˆÉ«É¯tÊƒ/). I am a PhD student (CDT in NLP) at the University of Edinburgh, working under the supervision of [Walid Magdy](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wmagdy/) and [Sharon Goldwater](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/sgwater/).
I am currently studying the variation across and between the Arabic dialects, their mutual intelligibility, and the implications of this variation on the creation of multi-dialect Arabic datasets.

Additionally, I am interested in Arabizi (the Romanized form of Arabic). I developed a [rule-based tool](https://pypi.org/project/franco-arabic-transliterator/) transliterating Arabizi into Arabic script. Ping me if you are interested in sharing ideas related to Arabizi (identification/transliteration/...), and/or collaborating on that!

Multilingualism is another field/cause that I am becoming more and more interested in!

As an undergraduate student, I was a competitive programming addict (lots of fun experiences ðŸ˜„). I am also an advocate of open-sourcing data/models/projects (twice a Google Summer of Code twice student for [Apertium](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/5982561396850688/), and [GNU Octave](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2016/projects/5461783343005696) + contributor to other projects like [Facebook/Duckling](https://github.com/facebook/duckling)).
