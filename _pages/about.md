Hello (Ø£Ù‡Ù„Ù‹Ø§ ÙˆØ³Ù‡Ù„Ù‹Ø§)! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

My name is Amr Keleg Ø¹Ù…Ø±Ùˆ Ù‚Ù„Ø¬ (/Ê•amr/ /kÉ¯ËˆÉ«É¯tÊƒ/). I am a PhD student (CDT in NLP) at the University of Edinburgh, working under the supervision of [Walid Magdy](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wmagdy/) and [Sharon Goldwater](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/sgwater/).
I am currently studying the variation across and between the Arabic dialects, their mutual intelligibility, and the implications of this variation on the creation of multi-dialect Arabic datasets.

Additionally, I am interested in Arabizi (the Romanized form of Arabic). I developed a [rule-based tool](https://pypi.org/project/franco-arabic-transliterator/) transliterating Arabizi into Arabic script. Ping me if you are interested in sharing ideas related to Arabizi (identification/transliteration/...), and/or collaborating on that!

Multilingualism is another field/cause that I am becoming more and more interested in!
