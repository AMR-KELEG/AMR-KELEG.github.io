Hello (Ø£Ù‡Ù„Ù‹Ø§ ÙˆØ³Ù‡Ù„Ù‹Ø§)! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

My name is Amr Keleg Ø¹Ù…Ø±Ùˆ Ù‚Ù„Ø¬ (/Ê•amr/ /kÉ¯ËˆÉ«É¯tÊƒ/). I am a PhD student (CDT in NLP) at the University of Edinburgh, working under the supervision of [Walid Magdy](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wmagdy/) and [Sharon Goldwater](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/sgwater/).
I am currently studying the variation across and between the Arabic dialects, their mutual intelligibility, and the implications of this variation on the creation of multi-dialect Arabic datasets.

Feel free to ping me if you are interested in discussing ideas related to the following interests, and/or collaborating on that!

### Research Interests
1) <b>Computationally Handling Dialectal Variation (focusing on Arabic)</b>
  * [Estimating the Level of Dialectness Predicts Inter-annotator Agreement in Multi-dialect Arabic Datasets](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.69/) - ACL 2024 (Outstanding Paper award, Oral presentation)
    * <u>Keleg, Amr</u>, Magdy, Walid, and Goldwater, Sharon
  * [NADI 2024: The Fifth Nuanced Arabic Dialect Identification Shared Task](https://aclanthology.org/2024.arabicnlp-1.79/) - ArabicNLP 2024 (Shared Task Organization, co-located with ACL 2024)
    * Abdul-Mageed, Muhammad, <u>Keleg, Amr</u>, Elmadany, AbdelRahim, Zhang, Chiyu, Hamed, Injy, Magdy, Walid, Bouamor, Houda, and Habash, Nizar
  * [ALDi: Quantifying the Arabic Level of Dialectness of Text](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.655/) - EMNLP 2023
    * <u>Keleg, Amr</u>, Goldwater, Sharon, and Magdy, Walid
  * [Arabic Dialect Identification under Scrutiny: Limitations of Single-label Classification](https://aclanthology.org/2023.arabicnlp-1.31/) - ArabicNLP 2023 (Oral presentation, co-located with EMNLP 2023)
    * <u>Keleg, Amr</u>, and Magdy, Walid


2) <b>Multilingual and Multicultural research</b>
  * [DLAMA: A Framework for Curating Culturally Diverse Facts for Probing the Knowledge of Pretrained Language Models](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.389/) - ACL 2023 (Findings)
    * <u>Keleg, Amr</u>, and Magdy, Walid
  * [An Unsupervised Method for Weighting Finite-state Morphological Analyzers](https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.474/) - LREC 2020
    * <u>Keleg, Amr</u>, Tyers, Francis, Howell, Nick, and Pirinen, Tommi

3) <b>Analyzing Romanized Writings of Non-Latin Languages</b>
  * I developed a [rule-based tool](https://pypi.org/project/franco-arabic-transliterator/) transliterating Arabizi (Romanized Arabic) into Arabic script.


### Other Interests
* As an undergraduate student, I was a competitive programming addict (lots of fun experiences ðŸ˜„). I am also an advocate of open-sourcing data/models/projects (twice a Google Summer of Code student for [Apertium](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/5982561396850688/), and [GNU Octave](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2016/projects/5461783343005696) + contributor to other projects like [Facebook/Duckling](https://github.com/facebook/duckling)).
