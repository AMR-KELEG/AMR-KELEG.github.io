These are my randomly layed takeaways from [TwitterDev talk](https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1430213348814049282) that was held to showcase how twitter was used in different research scenarios.

- Twitter API has now an easy way to get the whole conversation thread by querying using a `conversation_id` field.
- One can access the whole Twitter history using Twitter's research accounts (I found out that I have previously applied for one and my application got rejected ðŸ˜¢).
- There is another python package called `twarc` - might not be that new but it's the first time that I have heard of it- that interacts with Twitter's API and currently supports V2 of the API. `tweepy` is on the other hand currently working on supporting V2.
