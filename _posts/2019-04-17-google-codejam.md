description: A challenge with my undergraduate students

There is nothing better than getting back to the old days when I used to participate in online competitive programming contests.

This year we(Teacher Assistants and Graduates at Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University) have decided to hold a challenge against our students. The winner of the challenge should be the one who survives more throughout Google CodeJam's contests.

### Congrats - you’re advancing to Code Jam Round 2!
Today, I got an mail confirming that I have qualified to Round 2 after participating in Round 1A (The first contest out of 3 trials for qualification)🎉🎉🎉🎉

I came at the 1402 position out of the first 1500 qualified contestants. The position isn't impressive yet it's still accpetable for an old retired man like me 😃<br>
So that's a +1 for the TAs/Graduates team. Let's hope our team can still fight and survive.

### Personal solutions
Finally, you can find my solutions to Round 1A problems through:

See you in Round 2 🏆🏆
